          <strong>Early life</strong>
            - Hal was raised in a household with two religions. His father is Catholic and his mother is Jewish. As a child, Hal was traumatized by watching his father, a pilot, die in a plane crash. Refusing to bow down to fear, he followed in his father's footsteps and became a military test pilot, despite being terrified every time he flew.

Sur wanted Hal to replace him in the Green Lantern Corps, an intergalactic police force that had safeguarded the universe for billions of years.Hal accepted and was summoned for basic training to the Corps headquarters on the planet Oa. On completion, he was assigned to Thaal sinestro of Korugar.

              Let those who worship evil's might
         Beware my power--Green Lantern's light!"</p>
